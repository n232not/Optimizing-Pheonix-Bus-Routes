# Optimizing-Pheonix-Bus-Routes

A starting attempt to optimize Pheonix bus routes ing Python using agent-based modelling with the Mesa library, python google maps API, and genetic algorithms

## Goals/Steps to Complete:
1. Use the Google Maps API (probably its distance matrix system) to create a simplified map of pheonix and mark current bus stops/routes
2. Either use ABM or establish a reward based system to identify which destinations and areas on the map will have higher traffic/need and which areas will have less
3. Use a genetic algorithm to find an optimal way to maximize reward, establishing reasonable costs for the time it takes for buses to travel, adding more buses, and adding bus stations

Oh yeah, probably also need to conduct research on similar models.
